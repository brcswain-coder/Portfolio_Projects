# Manufacturing Defects Data Analysis

## 📌Project Overview
This project contains simulated data related to manufacturing defects observed during quality control processes. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fahmidachowdhury/manufacturing-defects?select=defects_data.csv) and contains the defect records of over 100 product IDs.

The objective is to analyze the patterns and to identify various problems in the workflow process. Using Structured Query Language (**SQL**) for data preparation and **Tableau** for data visualization, the raw data is transformed into insightful data.

This project demonstrates key elements of a Quality Management System (QMS)—including Quality Control Analysis, Process Improvement, Cost Analysis, and Product Quality Assurance—applied to manufacturing data for actionable insights.

- `outputs/` – aggregated tables and CSVs
- `visuals/` – charts and dashboards

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
- Tableau Public
- GitHub

## 🔑 Key Steps
1. Import raw dataset
2. Clean and explore with SQL
3. Export summarized data
4. Visualize with Tableau

## 📊 Results
- Quality Control Analysis
    1. Daily and monthly trend analysis revealed a drop in defect counts, indicating greater process stability and proactive quality control.
    2. Pareto analysis of defect type frequency indicates that **structural** and **functional** defect types account for ~70% of all defect types. Prioritizing these categories would yield significant impact on overall defect reduction.
- Process Improvement
    1. Defect location Pareto analysis revealed that nearly ~70% of all defects originated at the **surface** and **component** stages. Prioritizing corrective actions on the machines associated with these locations would significantly enhance process efficiency.
    2. Pareto analysis revealed that defects detected through **manual testing** and **visual inspection** account for ~70% of repair costs. Prioritizing improvements on these methods would provide long-term reduction in repair costs.
    3. Pareto analysis indicates the **top seven** defect type-severity combination that amount to 81% of overall repair costs. The remaining combinations that account for nearly 20% can be deprioritized for later improvement cycles.
- Cost Analysis
    1. The cost analysis aligns with the defect type frequency results, showing that structural and functional defects together represent the largest share of total repair costs. This consistency highlights these categories as the most critical targets for quality improvement initiatives.
    2. Contrary to the norm that **critical** defects are the primary cost drivers, Pareto analysis revealed that **minor** defects actually contribute the highest share of repair costs along with critical defects to account for ~70% of the total repair expenses. Prioritizing both would yield the greatest cost reduction impact.
