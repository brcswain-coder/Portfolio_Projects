# Manufacturing Defects Data Analysis

## 📌Project Overview
This project contains simulated data related to manufacturing defects observed during quality control processes. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fahmidachowdhury/manufacturing-defects?select=defects_data.csv) and contains the defect records of over 100 product IDs.

The objective is to analyze the patterns and to identify various problems in the workflow process. Using Structured Query Language (**SQL**) for data preparation and **Tableau** for data visualization, the raw data is transformed into insightful data.

This project demonstrates key elements of a Quality Management System (QMS)—including Quality Control Analysis, Process Improvement, Cost Analysis, and Product Quality Assurance—applied to manufacturing data for actionable insights.
